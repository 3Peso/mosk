# Refactoring run with logging in focus.
#  Use https://fangpenlin.com/posts/2012/08/26/good-logging-practice-in-python/ as basis.

# FileMetadata: Implement interpreter for "filetype and permissions (st_mode)"
# https://man7.org/linux/man-pages/man7/inode.7.html

# Implement SQLite Storage for protocol and collected data/files

# Add target directory parameter for mosk to define where logfiles and collected items
# needs to be stored

# Add content collection limit parameter for mosk, with which the size can be controlled
# which limits if the content of file will be stored inside the collection log itself. (Collector FileContent)

# Add SHA1 collection in addition to MD5 collection.

# Add parameter, for very quick collection (for example, no hash calculation, etc.)

# FolderInformation must provide the partition index

# Evaluate python imagemounter to mount image for collecting data from images - imount
# https://imagemounter.readthedocs.io/en/latest/python.html

# Use print function of macOS to print PDF exports of things like calendars, etc.

# Collector FileCopy: Think about guard against too long paths (old Windows issue)

# Collector to execute a generic command and collect the output (for example the "find" command)

# Preperations for portable usage (copy of bins, "compiled" version of tool, etc.)

# Collector to search in log files (for example for the string "Starting automatic backup",
#  https://eclecticlight.co/2021/03/17/time-machine-to-apfs-backing-up/)

# Implement a class to collect all FritzBox event logs and filter for certain signal words

# Add a database with MD5 hashes for systemfiles of macOS
#  see: https://eclecticlight.co/2021/03/02/what-has-changed-in-macos-and-why-it-matters/

# There is a bug somewhere in the EWFImage class or lower in the pytsk3 module. There are some files in the test
#  image which will be separadet from their path when creating the overview csv file
#  in FolerInfo.get_folder_items_in_csv_format()
#  Example: '2,./tests/EWFDemoFAT32.e01/2/02 Sig/Microsoft Windows Vista & Office 2007 Forensics, Office 2007 File Format.pptx'
